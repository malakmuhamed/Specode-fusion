SRS.pdf,"4 Maintainability
Our application is maintainable so the same team can easily maintain the application and get the
same output, no need for two teams iOS team and Android team to get the required output",Non-Functional
SRS.pdf,"Results: As a result for this experiment, researchers found that the performance of the Long-short
term memory network better than Ada boosting, XG boosting , multiplayer perception and Gradi-
ent boosting",Non-Functional
SRS.pdf,"Results: After doing some experiments using the QRFC and NV A, it concluded that both methods
are easily implemented into smartphones and they have the same performance and accuracy, how-
ever, QRFC took much less time than that required for static sampling (SS), also researchers see
that in the future, QRFC will be the most important technique for signal sampling",Non-Functional
